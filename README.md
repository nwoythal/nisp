This file is an experiment in Daniel Holden's 'Build Your Own Lisp'. The aim of this is to not only have my own personal dialect of lisp, but to further my understanding of languages and exceptions in languages, and to improve upon my C skills. I have completed up through chapter 9.

To compile, just run the script provided, it will link all the necessary files, as well as update the output file.
These files have dependencies on mpc and editline.
